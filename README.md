# hachi

A small 808 drum machine for monome norns.
I've written this to start my learning process of Lua and SuperCollider.   
The sound engine is based on the SC808 by [Yoshinosuke Horiuchi](https://www.patreon.com/4H). I've implemented only my favorite sounds, to keep the GUI in a single norns page.
The sequencer borrow some techniques from *playfair* euclidean drummer written by [@tehn](https://github.com/tehn), with some new features (randomizer, real time recording).
